Cleanup::
* pull unsat_plus_unsat_zero into unsat_plus proof
* factor out common code for stuck and soundness of S1, S, and IO?
* factor out common code for preservation_multi, unsat_preserves_multi,
  unsat_expands_multi?
* eliminate Admitted everywhere in the library for theorems I use.
* Reduce the library to just those things I use.
